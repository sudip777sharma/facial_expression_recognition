    "1. Model:\n",
    "A model is a specific representation learned from data by applying some machine learning algorithm. A model is also called hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Feature:\n",
    "A feature is an individual measurable property of our data. A set of numeric features can be conveniently described by a feature vector. Feature vectors are fed as input to the model. For example, in order to predict a fruit, there may be features like color, smell, taste, etc.\n",

    "    Note: Choosing informative, discriminating and independent features is a crucial step for effective algorithms. We generally employ a feature extractor to extract the relevant features from the raw data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Target (Label):\n",
    "A target variable or label is the value to be predicted by our model. For the fruit example discussed in the features section, the label with each set of input would be the name of the fruit like apple, orange, banana, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Training:\n",
    "The idea is to give a set of inputs(features) and it’s expected outputs(labels), so after training, we will have a model (hypothesis) that will then map new data to one of the categories trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Prediction:\n",
    "Once our model is ready, it can be fed a set of inputs to which it will provide a predicted output(label)."
